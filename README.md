# About me

Hi, My name is bharat. i was trying to build websites using ai and then lost a few projects because i had no control over the progress of my projects. that's why i am here to learn github and manage everything well. and talking about me, i love playing guitar, reading interesting things, meditating and yes i don't know any coding, for now. i believe in just-in-time learning, meaning we should learn something only when we need it.
